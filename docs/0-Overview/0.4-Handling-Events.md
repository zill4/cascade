The DOM has built-in support for **Event-Driven** programming.  This means your application can sit around and wait for user input or other **Events**.  Once an `Event` has occurred, its information is sent to a function called an `EventListener`.

We saw an example of this during the last section for handling `change` events from `<input>` elements.  


## Event Listeners

Using classical JavaScript **DOM Element Attributes**

```` TypeScript
/* Code */
function handleClick() {
    ...
}

/* View */
<button onclick="handleClick()" />
````

Using JSX to inject `EventListeners`.

```` TypeScript
/* Code */
class ViewModel {
    handleClick() {
        ...
    }
}

/* View */
<button onclick={viewModel.handleClick.bind(this)} />
````

Using TypeScript arrow methods to simplify syntax.

```` TypeScript
/* Code */
class ViewModel {
    handleClick = () => {
        ...
    }
}

/* View */
<button onclick={viewModel.handleClick} />
````

## Asynchronous Programming

JavaScript can be written as **asynchronous** code, meaning it doesn't have to always run in order.  Most of the time this isn't the case, as instructions are executed one after another.

## Event Propagation

```` TypeScript
Event.stopPropagation();
Event.preventDefault();
````
