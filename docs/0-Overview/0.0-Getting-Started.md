Using Cascade requires only a few steps.  It's designed for TypeScript, but is completely compatible with pure JavaScript.

## Installing TypeScript

For simplicity in these tutorials, you can download a simple boilerplate at [https://github.com/sjohnsonaz/ts-boilerplate](https://github.com/sjohnsonaz/ts-boilerplate).  Follow its instructions to get a TypeScript environment up and running.  Otherwise, you will need to set up Node, TypeScript, and Webpack to compile and run these projects.

## Installing Cascade

For TypeScript, it is recommended to install Cascade via npm.  It should be installed as a "dependency" for most projects, unless you're creating a shared library.  Shared libraries should install Cascade as a "peerDependency".

    npm install cascade --save

Cascade can also be downloaded from [https://github.com/sjohnsonaz/cascade/releases](https://github.com/sjohnsonaz/cascade/releases).
