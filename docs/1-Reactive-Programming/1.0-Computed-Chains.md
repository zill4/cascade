Cascade uses `observable` and `computed` properties to synchronize data across its Objects.  To do this, it uses a form of **Reactive Programming**, in which values across the data structure are linked together.  So if a value is changed in one portion, other portions might *React* and update themselves.

## Computed Properties

A `computed` property is merely a function which runs to calculate a value.  However, if the `computed` references an `observable` property, and that property is updated, the `computed` will be run again.

## Push Updates

When an `observable` updates, its values is pushed to its subscribers.  However, those subscribers then wait for all changes to be, so that updates can be processed all at once.

## Pull Updates

When an `computed` has been marked dirty, and something needs its value immediately, it will be calculated immediately.
